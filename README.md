# Clinic_Management_System
This project was developed by Dhriti, Lakshanya and I as a part of our 12th grade Computer Science Project using MYSQL.

We made a small python project by connecting mysql database to it so that we could perform the following actions:
- Book appointments
- Enter patient or doctor details
- update patient or doctor details
